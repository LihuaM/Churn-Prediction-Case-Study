# Churn-Prediction-Case-Study

A ride-sharing company (Company X) is interested in predicting rider retention.

The dataset contains users who signed up for an account in January 2014. The data was pulled on July 1, 2014. We consider a user retained if they were “active” (i.e. took a trip) in the preceding 30 days (from the day the data was pulled).

We would like to use this data set to help understand what factors are the best predictors for retention, and offer suggestions to operationalize those insights to help Company X.
